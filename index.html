<h1>About Dior</h1>
<p> “Whatever you do – whether for work or pleasure  do it with passion! Live with passion,” wrote Christian Dior. Well before he embarked on his destiny as a couturier, Christian Dior was fascinated with art. The young Normandy native and several friends opened an art gallery when he was just 23. In 1938 he learned the métier of pattern cutter with Robert Piguet and three years later began working as a designer for Lucien Lelong. Right from the founding of his Maison in 1946, he transformed his dreams into irresistible creations, seeking to break with the somber war years by elevating pure joy. His visionary spirit celebrated and enchanted women the world over. In only ten years, Monsieur Dior revolutionized the conventions of elegance and femininity, designing collections infused with dreams.</p>
